# Palamedes

## Description 

Palamedes is a utility  useful to native Greek speakers and Greek scholars
(Hellenists) who wish to type traditional Greek (often referred to as
multi-accented or polytonic) under the Microsoft Windows Operating system (all
versions post Windows XP).  This utility  allows the typing of multi-accented
(polytonic) Greek text in the manner of writing by hand. Accents and
breathings are typed after the vowels in any order without dead keys. In other
words, first we type the letter and then we "decorate" it with the required
accents.  Palamedes also facilitates the typing
of punctuation and other symbols used int the Greek script. 

The main accent keys are as follows:

| KEY          |     ACCENT          |
|:------------:|:------------------- |
|/             | Oxia (acute)
|\             | Varia (grave)
|~ (or =)      | Perispomeni (circumflex)
|]             | Psili  (lenis)
|[             | Dasia (asper)
|"             | Dialytika (diaeresis)
|\|            | Ypogegrammeni (Iota subscript)

For example to produce an **á¾„** we type 'a' followed by any combination 
of the keys '/', ']' and '|'.

Note: The function of the dead key (;) has been retained. 

Palamedes is written in C and it uses the Windows API to hook and modify the
key press events.  


## Compiling

The easiest way is to use GNU make and MinGW GCC.  CD to the src directory and
type 'make'.  This will build the executable 'palamedes.exe" and its hooking
library 'hook.dll'

With some modifications to the source files it can also be build with
Microsoft Visual Studio. The required changes are shown the  comments in the
source files.
